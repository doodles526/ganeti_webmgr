Ganeti Web Manager
==================

|gwm| is a Django_ based web frontend for managing Ganeti_ virtualization
clusters. Since Ganeti only provides a command-line interface, |gwm|'s
goal is to provide a user friendly interface to Ganeti by being feature
complete with Ganeti's :ref:`RAPI <rapi>`. On top of Ganeti it
provides a permission system for managing access to clusters and virtual
machines and an in browser VNC console.

If you don't already have a Ganeti cluster setup, these directions_ can
help you get started. If you are looking for support, please contact us
through these :ref:`channels <contact>`. If you are looking to deploy
|gwm| for the first time, check out our :ref:`installation` guide. If
you already have a |gwm| instance running it might be time to
:ref:`upgrade <upgrading>`.


|gwm| is licensed under the :ref:`GPLv2 <license>`. It is currently
developed and maintained by the Oregon State University Open Source Lab
and a handful of volunteers. If you would like to get involved in
development see our :ref:`development <development>` guide.
